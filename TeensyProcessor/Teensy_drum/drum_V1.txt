Teensy Drum machine 

Two velocity sensitive pads for a 16-step sequencer. 
Play/pause button, stop button and record button. Probably learn button later. 
Two pots or REs to select sound and maybe an LCD or OLED screen. 
16 neopixels to represent the sequence. 

When record is played, you can play in the sounds you want and it will store 
that. When you playback, it plays the loop you've created

Questions:
    Does it make more sense to play waveform or wav file from SD?
    Will polyphonic playback allow for sounds to be played simultaneously?

To do: 
    create a sequencer object that has a BPM, timer, steps, channels
