midi wrapper from abstraction to low level synthesizer

1- what instrument is this for?
2- what pitch? (this is only if it's not a percussive instrument)
3- what velocity?

the wrapper should handle channel switching instruments, making sure to only switch instruments
which have no notes playing, etc.

there also needs to be support for pitch bend, etc. but that can come later


three things
1. enum instrument list
2. enum note list
3. wrapper/other pojo-oriented classes that handles building midi events from instrument and pitch + velocity


There should be a MIDIConstants class in midinotes, with all the constants needed so they aren't all over the place


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI


classes:
MidiConstants (import from billthefarmers stuff)
Notes (enum of notes and conversion to midi pitch byte based on octave)
Instruments (enum of instruments)
InstrumentEvent (instrument + note + velocity + exceptional-case-handler class)
MidiEvent (literally just a 3 byte wrapper class)
InstrumentPlayer (converts instrumentEvent into series of midiEvents)

InstrumentPlayer (needs to be initialized to get the MIDI writer)



for next time, change Notes from enum to pojo class, add in flat/sharp and static/instance translation support
