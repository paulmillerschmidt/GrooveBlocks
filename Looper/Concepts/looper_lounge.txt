LOOPER LOUNGE 

The looper lounge is a self-contained looping system that allows the user
to play around with different instruments, sounds, effects and MIDI clips. 

The central board is a raspberry pi that has a few different controls. It 
has a loop length pot, a bpm pot a major/minor switch, a key pot and a meter
switch (3/4 or 4/4). It also as buttons for start/pause and stop.

Connected to the central unit are a series of "instruments" that are in 
the form of Arduinos. They are plastic blocks with connectors that either
snap or connect magnetically to the central unit, relaying serial data
(though we will switch to I2C soon). There are mutiple different instruments, 
drums, keys/pads, bass, lead. That is the starter kit. The instruments will 
also have knobs that can affect overall volume of the track, but most automation
will be handled in the arrangement view. 

On top of each instrument come a few different nodes. These nodes are resistors
that the Arduino reads and compiles. It then transmits a unique 3-digit code
to the raspberry pi telling it which audio file to play. 

There are there different node options: instrument, clip and effect, though
more will be added. The instrument node tells the CPU which specific sound
it wants to use (i.e. electric guitar vs acoustic, rhodes piano vs organ). 
The effect can be reverb, delay, filter, overdrive, etc. The MIDI clip can be
any particular MIDI pattern. The raspberry pi will have a file that has every
specific combination of instrument/clip/effects and plays that unique file
back. Hopefully, the effects will have pots on them that we can use to automate
or change the effect, but we are not quite there yet. 


The lights represent certain movements/character of the node.
