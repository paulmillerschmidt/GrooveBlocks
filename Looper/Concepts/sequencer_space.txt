SEQUENCER SPACE

The Sequencer Space is a multi-channel, multi-step sequencer capable of
playing bounced scenes from the Looper Lounge and preset audio files
(ex. transitions, drum loops, buildups, etc.)

The Sequencer Space has four channels for synchronous audio playback, all
of which run on their own threads. Each channel has a knob that 
updates its corresponding channel's volume in live time. 

Preset audio files or bounced audio scenes are placed in one or span across
multiple steps in a channel. This is accomplished by having an incomplete 
circuit in each position, and the movable audio files have unique resistor
values that complete the circuits. These positions also connect to a microchip
(MCP3008) that converts the analog signal from the resistor to a digital, readable
value in the Rasberry Pi. This gives all the necessary identifiable information for
a preset audio file or bounced scene(position, and unique resistor value).

The goal of the Sequencer Space is to force the user to think about musical 
composition beyond creating one catchy loop. Similair to conventional song
writing, where there are several different sections, the Sequencer Space
can order and mix the different musical moments into finished song. It is 
very reminiscent of a DAW, and it is supposed to be, because playing with the
Sequencer SPace will develop the users basic music production skillset necessary
to use a more complicated DAW later on.
